  SADYCOS is a simulation environment for satellite dynamics
  and control algorithms implemented in MATLAB Simulink. It
  features a structure that allows for a highly customizable
  creation and execution of satellite simulations. A
  constantly expanding library of models is provided to
  enable the user to quickly set up new simulations. By
  implementing custom models and controllers, the user is in
  charge of making an own trade-off between simulation speed
  and level of detail.
