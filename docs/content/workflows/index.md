# Workflows

This page provides a collection of workflows for common tasks in SADYCOS.
Each workflow is a step-by-step guide that explains how to perform a specific task in SADYCOS. 
To understand the internal processes that are involved in these workflows, refer to the section [Simulation Setup]({% link content/setup/index.md %}).
